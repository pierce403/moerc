== Preface

Welcome to the **Metal Oxide Electrolysis Refinement Chamber (MOERC)** build guide. This edition aligns with the v0.1 field manual and captures the exact configuration used to turn approximately 1 kg of oxide feed into a 200 g learning‑grade silicon ingot using molten oxide electrolysis followed by vacuum refining and casting.

=== About this release

* **Process chain:** MOE (Fe→Si→Al staging) → vacuum refining → directional casting.
* **Power & utilities:** 120 V mains with an inline ≥1.8 kW battery/inverter for ride‑through and clean control power.
* **Budget target:** <\$10k by combining commercial off‑the‑shelf (COTS) parts with surplus and DIY fabrication.
* **Footprint:** Bench stack roughly 0.8 m × 0.6 m × 1.2 m for the full module set.

The goal of this document is to reproduce that baseline as faithfully as possible so that later upgrades can be layered on with confidence.

=== Who this guide is for

This guide assumes hands‑on familiarity with fabrication, high‑temperature lab work, and industrial electrical practice. You should be comfortable welding or bolting a frame, plumbing vacuum hardware, wiring control cabinets, and validating instrumentation.

=== How to use this manual

Each chapter corresponds to the build sequence used in the v0.1 manual:

. System overview and performance envelope.
. Bill of materials broken out by subsystem.
. Step‑by‑step build instructions from frame to controls.
. Commissioning, operation, and post‑run maintenance.
. Appendices with setpoints, minimal tool lists, and consumable expectations.

Read the entire manual before committing hardware. Cross‑linking between chapters mirrors the way the hardware is staged, so you can mark off sections as they are completed.

=== Safety first

The MOERC operates at 1600–1900 °C, emits bright thermal radiation, evolves oxygen, and draws high current from mains power. Review the dedicated xref:safety.adoc[Safety Guidelines] chapter, prepare your workspace, and stage PPE before any build or operation work begins.
