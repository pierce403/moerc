= Maintenance

== Routine schedule (Section 7)

* Inspect liners and electrodes after every ~10 hours at temperature. Replace worn anode faces and document cathode recession.
* Bake the argon dryer and replace filters quarterly or when differential pressure rises beyond spec.
* Clean cold traps after each run; capture and store condensed SiO for potential reclaim or proper disposal.
* Calibrate pyrometers quarterly and verify LIBS/OES wavelength alignment during each daily warm-up cycle.

== Post-run service

. Allow the system to cool below 200 °C before opening.
. Remove slag and residual metal from the phase-separation pockets. Check for erosion or cracks and replace inserts if necessary.
. Inspect vacuum seals, pump oil, and scroll tips. Top off or service pumps according to manufacturer recommendations.
. Empty and regenerate desiccant beds in the argon dryer if moisture breakthrough is detected.

== Spares & consumables

* Maintain at least one spare ZrO₂ liner and an Al₂O₃ backup set.
* Stock replacement electrodes or coatings (IrO₂) to avoid downtime.
* Keep desiccant cartridges, filters, and cold-trap cups in rotation so cleaning cycles do not halt production.

== Record keeping

Log maintenance actions alongside batch data. Tracking liner hours, electrode wear, and pump service intervals is essential for correlating yield changes with hardware condition.
