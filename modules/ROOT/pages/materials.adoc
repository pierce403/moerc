* 120 V line conditioner/UPS or portable power station (≥1.8 kW continuous, ~1.5 kWh) — **$1,000**
* Power distribution unit, breakers, cabling, GFCI, and grounding hardware — **$300**
* Optional 400–600 W PV input cabling for recharging the storage pack — **$200**

== Budget guidance

* **Subtotal (new parts):** ~\$10,800
* **Targeted v0.1 build cost:** \$8.8k–9.8k when leveraging surplus UPS/pumps/spectrometers (–\$800 to –\$1,500), choosing resistance heaters over induction (–\$300), limiting to a single pyrometer (–\$150), and fabricating the frame in-house (–\$200).

Document every substitution so operating parameters can be adjusted accordingly. Consumables and tool requirements are summarized in the xref:appendix.adoc[Appendix].
