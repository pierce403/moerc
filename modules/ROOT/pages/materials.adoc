= Materials & Components

== Required Materials

This section lists all materials and components needed to construct the MOERC. Items are organized by subsystem for easier procurement and organization.

=== Chamber Construction

==== Structural Components
* Stainless steel chamber body (316L grade recommended)
* High-temperature gaskets and seals
* Insulation materials (ceramic fiber blanket)
* Viewing ports (borosilicate glass)

==== Fasteners and Hardware
* High-temperature bolts and nuts (A286 stainless steel)
* Washers and spacers
* Threaded rods and mounting brackets

=== Electrical System

==== Power Supply
* DC power supply (0-50V, 0-500A) with current regulation
* Power cables (high-current, insulated)
* Safety disconnect switches
* Circuit breakers and fuses

==== Electrodes
* Graphite anodes (high-purity grade)
* Copper cathodes (99.9% pure)
* Electrode holders and insulators
* Connection hardware

=== Control System

==== Sensors
* Type K thermocouples (high-temperature rated)
* Current shunts for amperage monitoring
* Voltage monitoring circuits
* Pressure sensors (if applicable)

==== Control Electronics
