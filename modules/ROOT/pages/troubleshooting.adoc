= Troubleshooting

This chapter ties common symptoms to the v0.1 operating procedures. Use it alongside xref:operation.adoc[Operation Manual], xref:control-system.adoc[Control System], and xref:maintenance.adoc[Maintenance].

== MOE stage issues

|===
|Symptom|Likely cause|Corrective action (reference)

|Fe sump fails to accumulate
|Cathodic overpotential too high or insufficient settling time
|Return to the Fe window parameters (low current density ~0.2–0.4 A cm⁻²) and hold until OES Fe lines stabilize. Allow extra dwell before tapping.

|Silicon alloying with iron
|Fe sump temperature too high or Si stage ramp too aggressive
|Lower sump temperature, reduce potential step to 10 %, and pause feeding until LIBS/OES indicates separation (Section 4.3).

|Excessive bubbling or spatter
|Rapid feed rate or trapped gas pathways
|Reduce feed rate, verify gas ports are clear, and ensure the argon blanket is within the 50–150 mbar range.
|===

== Vacuum refining problems

|===
|Symptom|Likely cause|Corrective action

|RGA shows rising phosphorous despite hold
|Insufficient temperature or pressure not reaching ≤10 Pa
|Increase refining temperature toward 1800 °C and verify vacuum integrity using the dry-run leak criteria.

|RGA spike at m/z ~44 (SiO)
|Over-evaporation or cold-trap warming
|Tighten cold-trap cooling, lower refining temperature slightly, and inspect trap fill level between runs (Section 4.4).
|===

== Casting defects

|===
|Symptom|Likely cause|Corrective action

|Impurity bands through ingot
|Cooling rate too fast or directional cooling disrupted
|Reset casting ramp to 1–5 K min⁻¹ from bottom to top. Confirm mold coating is intact (Section 4.5).

|Surface oxidation on poured ingot
|Transfer exposure to air
|Use a covered transfer crucible and minimize transit time from refining pot to mold.

== Sensor anomalies

* Pyrometers drifting: Recalibrate against reference per the testing chapter and check purge gas cleanliness.
* LIBS/OES noise: Inspect optical windows for condensate buildup and realign fibers after cleaning.
* Vacuum gauge disagreement: Re-zero Pirani and capacitance manometer, confirm gauge placement is per the utilities chapter.

Document troubleshooting steps alongside batch records so recurring patterns can be addressed during scheduled maintenance.
