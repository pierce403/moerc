== Upgrade path (Section 8)

* Deploy an inert ceramic-metal anode to eliminate residual carbon contact.
* Expand the MOE pot with dual-zone heaters for higher throughput.
* Upgrade spectrometers for deeper UV coverage to resolve trace boron/phosphorus.
* Automate tapping and ladle handling, integrating spectral feedback for closed-loop recipe tuning.

== Target setpoints (Appendix A)

* MOE hot-zone: **1625 °C** nominal.
* Fe stage: current density **0.2–0.4 A cm⁻²**, tuned via OES.
* Si stage: increase potential by **10–20 %** compared to the Fe stage, watching silicon emission and headspace oxygen.
* Vacuum refining: **1700–1800 °C**, **≤10 Pa**, **30–90 min** hold.

== Minimal tools (Appendix B)

* IR thermometer for quick checks.
* Torque drivers, crimp kits, and electrical hand tools.
* TIG-grade gloves, tongs, face shield, and PPE described in the safety chapter.
* Precision scale and sieve set for feed preparation.

== Expected consumables per 10 runs (Appendix C)

* Argon: ≤1 m³ with reclaim.
* Liners: 1 primary ZrO₂ liner plus 1 Al₂O₃ backup.
* Anode face or coating: replace as needed if consumable.

== Cost recap

The v0.1 build lands at **\$8.8–9.8k** when leveraging surplus procurement strategies detailed in xref:materials.adoc[Materials & Components]. Track actual expenses to refine future revisions of the manual.
