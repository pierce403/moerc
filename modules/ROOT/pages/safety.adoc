= Safety Guidelines

== Critical Safety Information

WARNING: The MOERC operates with high voltages, high temperatures, and potentially hazardous chemicals. Failure to follow safety procedures can result in serious injury or death.

== General Safety Principles

=== Before You Begin
* Read and understand all safety guidelines
* Ensure proper training on all equipment and procedures
* Have emergency contacts and procedures readily available
* Verify that your workspace meets all safety requirements

=== Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

==== Always Required
* Safety glasses with side protection
* Heat-resistant gloves rated for temperatures up to 1000Â°C
* Closed-toe shoes with non-slip soles
* Long pants and long-sleeved shirts (natural fibers preferred)

==== When Applicable
* Chemical-resistant aprons when handling electrolytes
* Respiratory protection when exposure to fumes is possible
* Face shields for high-risk operations
* Hearing protection in noisy environments

== Electrical Safety

=== High Voltage Precautions
* Always de-energize system before maintenance
* Use lockout/tagout procedures
* Verify zero energy state with appropriate test equipment
* Never work alone on electrical systems

=== Grounding and Bonding
* Ensure all equipment is properly grounded
* Verify ground fault protection is installed and functional
* Use GFCI-protected outlets where applicable
* Maintain proper equipment grounding throughout operation

== Thermal Safety

=== High Temperature Hazards
* Allow adequate cooling time before maintenance
* Use appropriate thermal barriers and insulation
* Monitor surface temperatures of accessible components
* Provide clear warning labels on hot surfaces

=== Thermal Protection Systems
* Install thermal overload protection
* Implement temperature monitoring and alarms
* Ensure adequate ventilation for heat dissipation
* Maintain thermal barriers around personnel areas

== Chemical Safety

=== Electrolyte Handling
* Use only approved chemicals and concentrations
* Store chemicals according to manufacturer specifications
* Provide appropriate spill containment and cleanup materials
* Never mix incompatible chemicals

=== Waste Disposal
* Follow local regulations for chemical waste disposal
* Neutralize electrolytes before disposal when required
* Properly label and store waste materials
* Maintain waste disposal records

== Emergency Procedures

=== Emergency Shutdown
* Locate and test all emergency stop controls
* Ensure emergency shutdown procedures are posted and understood
* Provide multiple methods to de-energize the system
* Train all operators on emergency procedures

=== First Aid and Emergency Response
* Maintain current first aid supplies appropriate for chemical and electrical hazards
* Post emergency contact numbers prominently
* Ensure fire extinguishers are appropriate for electrical and chemical fires
* Provide emergency eyewash and shower facilities

== Workspace Requirements

=== Ventilation
* Provide adequate ventilation to remove process gases and heat
* Install gas detection systems where appropriate
* Ensure makeup air is sufficient for safe operation
* Regular testing and maintenance of ventilation systems

=== Fire Prevention
* Use appropriate fire suppression systems
* Maintain clear egress paths
* Store flammable materials safely
* Regular inspection and testing of fire safety equipment
