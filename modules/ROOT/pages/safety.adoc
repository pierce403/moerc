= Safety Guidelines

== Hazard summary (Section 6)

* **Thermal:** Process temperatures exceed 1700 °C. Maintain radiant shields, use IR-rated PPE, and keep combustible materials clear of the hot zone.
* **Gas:** Oxygen is evolved during electrolysis. Provide positive venting away from personnel. The process is HF-free; off-gas is primarily O₂/Ar/SiO captured by cold traps.
* **Electrical:** 120 V mains at high current. Use bonded grounds, GFCI protection, and an emergency stop that drops heater power. Ensure the UPS/inverter is sized for continuous draw.
* **Optical:** Bright hot surfaces and potential arc light demand UV/IR eye protection when inspecting.
* **Mechanical:** Guard moving hardware such as the auger, interlock access panels, and post hot-work signage in the lab.

== Personal protective equipment

Always stage the following before build or operation work:

* Face shield and IR/UV-rated eye protection when observing the hot zone.
* Heat-rated gloves (TIG-grade) and insulated aprons for handling hot components.
* Respiratory protection when servicing the argon loop, cold traps, or handling fine powders.
* Closed-toe, non-slip footwear and flame-resistant clothing.

== Administrative controls

* Develop lockout/tagout procedures covering heaters, pumps, and control power.
* Keep a current bill of materials, wiring diagrams, and emergency contacts posted near the workstation.
* Train all personnel on emergency stop location, oxygen vent routing, and spill response.
* Maintain clear walkways and segregate gas cylinders or power gear from general traffic areas.

== Startup checklist

. Inspect liners, electrodes, and insulation for cracks or contamination.
. Verify argon flow, oxygen vent routing, and that the cold-trap coolant loop is primed.
. Test interlocks and emergency stops prior to heating.
. Confirm PPE availability and that observers understand stay-out zones.

== Shutdown checklist

. Ramp heaters down under control; avoid opening the hot zone until temperatures fall below 200 °C.
. Keep ventilation running until oxygen evolution ceases and cold traps have warmed to safe handling temperature.
. Lock out power sources before performing maintenance.
. Dispose of or recycle collected condensates per local regulations.
