== At-a-glance

* **Batch size:** ~1 kg dry SiO₂-dominant feed → ~200 g silicon learning target.
* **Process chain:** Molten oxide electrolysis (Fe→Si→Al staging) → vacuum refining → directional solidification.
* **Operating temperatures:** 1600–1700 °C in the MOE cell; 1600–1900 °C during vacuum refining; 1450–1550 °C for casting.
* **Power input:** 120 V AC service with a ≥1.8 kW inverter/UPS inline to ride through sag events and isolate controls.
* **Atmosphere management:** Argon backfill loop with reclaim, oxygen evolution venting, and cold-trapped exhaust.
* **Footprint:** Bench-top stack, approximately 0.8 m × 0.6 m × 1.2 m for the complete module set.

== System architecture

The v0.1 build organizes the hardware into eight cooperating modules. Work through them in order to maintain clear interfaces.

. **Feed prep & autofeed** – Hopper, auger, dryer (150–250 °C), and screening (≤250 µm) with an optional jaw crusher for raw rock.
. **MOE cell (melter + electrolyzer)** – Insulated hot zone with ZrO₂/Al₂O₃ liners, refractory metal electrodes, and staged potentials for selective reduction.
. **Phase separation** – Weir and sump geometry that parks iron in a deep pocket, skims slag, and directs silicon into an isolated collection pocket.
. **Vacuum refining pot** – Dedicated vessel rated for 1600–1900 °C at ≤10 Pa with cold traps to capture SiO and phosphorous species.
. **Ingot casting** – Directional solidification station using Si₃N₄-coated crucibles and a controlled cool-down plate.
. **Gas & vacuum skid** – Rotary vane pump, optional dry scroll, argon buffer, dryer, filter stack, and oxygen vent/capture plumbing.
. **Controls & sensing** – PLC or industrial micro, pyrometry, LIBS/OES for spectral feedback, residual gas analysis, and interlocks.
. **Power & energy** – 120 V line conditioner or portable power station feeding heaters and controls with proper bonding and protection.

== Utilities and support equipment

* **Electrical:** 120 V, 15–20 A circuit with GFCI protection, bonded grounds, and separated clean power for controls.
* **Cooling:** Water loop for cold traps and any induction coil jackets; ensure flow monitoring before high-temperature work.
* **Instrumentation:** Dual two-color pyrometers, LIBS head for feed characterization, OES aimed at the melt, and RGA on the refining foreline.
* **Gas handling:** Argon reclaim loop with buffer tank, dryer, and filtration; oxygen vent line routed to a safe exhaust or capture bottle.
