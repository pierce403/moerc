:description: Download the MOERC build manual and bill of materials for offline use.

Looking for offline copies of the guide? Grab the curated files below. Each download bundles the latest v0.1 content from this
site so you can reference it without an internet connection.

== Need an all-in-one package?

Project policy prohibits distributing binary ZIP archives directly from the repository, so we publish the PDF and CSV as
individual downloads. To mirror the previous bundle locally, download both files above and archive them with your preferred
tool:

[,bash]
----
zip moerc-build-kit.zip moerc-build-guide-v0.1.pdf moerc-bom-v0.1.csv
----
